Diligent E-Commerce Website — Prompts Used
==========================================

This document lists the key prompts intentionally designed and used to generate the project's deliverables. 
Each section reflects my reasoning process and structured prompting approach to create clean, modular, and production-oriented outputs.

------------------------------------------------------------
🧭 Goal: Create a concise technical architecture document for a lightweight MERN e-commerce project.
💬 Prompt Used:
"Draft a professional technical architecture document for an e-commerce website built using the MERN stack. 
Include: project overview, frontend–backend architecture, key endpoints, database setup, state management, 
and deployment recommendations. Keep the tone concise and technical, similar to what a candidate would submit with a project."

------------------------------------------------------------
🧭 Goal: Develop a simple yet realistic backend API using Express.js and MongoDB Atlas.
💬 Prompt Used:
"Write an Express.js backend with sample routes:
- GET /api/products
- GET /api/products/:id
- POST /api/cart/checkout (mock)
Use Mongoose for product models, include a seed.js script for sample data, 
and ensure the project can run locally with .env configuration for MongoDB Atlas."

------------------------------------------------------------
🧭 Goal: Design a clean React frontend with Tailwind CSS and Material UI integration.
💬 Prompt Used:
"Create a React frontend with Tailwind CSS and Material UI components. 
Include pages for product listing, product details, and cart management. 
Implement React Router for navigation and localStorage for cart state persistence. 
Keep the UI minimal, responsive, and visually consistent."

------------------------------------------------------------
🧭 Goal: Ensure submission includes clear instructions and deliverables.
💬 Prompt Used:
"Prepare three final deliverables for the Diligent assignment:
1. Technical Architecture PDF (professional, concise)
2. Codebase folder (frontend + backend)
3. Prompts file documenting the prompt strategy used to generate the deliverables."

------------------------------------------------------------
🧭 Goal: Optimize presentation for evaluation.
💬 Prompt Used:
"Format the prompts file in a human-readable structure that highlights the logical flow of prompt design and intention. 
Avoid any AI identifiers or unnecessary verbosity — keep it transparent, strategic, and professional."
